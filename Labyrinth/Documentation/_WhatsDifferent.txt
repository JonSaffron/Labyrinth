- The routines for animating the monsters are very different.

Firstly, their "AI" is completely different, and their position is maintained
off the screen.

- The way fruit is distributed.

Originally, a set amount of fruit is expected when a new level is started.
If fruit is not collected from an earlier level then a new piece of fruit
will not become available. The split between what type of fruit is created
is random.

- Some floor/wall tiles and other sprites

There are new floor and wall tiles where appropriate. Some sprites
have had some very minor tweaks where they looked odd under a greater
resolution.
