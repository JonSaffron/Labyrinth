World should not be a public property of StaticItem
Should Reset be a common method?
collect game objects together into a separate object (rather than linked list)


green kiler cube not shooting, and seems to change frame too quickly
can't shoot eggs
shots go through walls
can't shoot fruit or mushrooms
mushrooms are planted not square on tiles, or on top of other mushrooms
when egg is laid, the monster that laid the egg animates as an egg


Solid objects.... walls, 

Player can



crushing monsters and player
new level sound
restart position and energy
map monsters/crystal/forcefields position
monsters movement & behaviour
count of fruit per level
die if in forcefield
monsters shooting
record position of static monsters, fruit, etc
mushrooms
gravestone
forcefield not present impedes shots
how to finish level?

if moving towards a blank space then tend to keep moving in the same direction
	if not going to continue, then change direction by 90 degrees in a free direction. If no free direction then keep going.
If space ahead is not free, then tend to go back in opposite direction. Or a free 90 degree direction.
If aggressive, and on same or adjacent line to player and moving perpendicular than may change direction.

-- Flittering

cautious movement

-- shot bouncing off stuff

-- laying mushrooms

firing in monster class bang when monster fires

-- turn shot into bang
